# My NASA API Project
This project involves entering in a date, to which it will return live NASA published on that date. Examples of this includes a photo or video, along with an explanation of said photo/video.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I utilized the fetch API method (the concept of RESTful APIs), as well as JSON parsing, to request data from a NASA url containing a unique API key.
I then converted that data into JSON format for JavaScript readability purposes, and used that to access information such as properties and attributes within that data. 
After, I proceeded to manipulate the DOM using document query selectors to replace the current html content, with content provided by those properties.
In the CSS file, I styled very simple parts of the page such as the background color, alignment of content, and margin-spacing. I also used media queries.
Most of the project was done using JavaScript.

## Optimizations
Optimized web responsiveness by using media queries for many devices including Desktop/Laptops/Ipads/Iphones/Pixels/Kindles.

## Lessons Learned:
Main lesson learned: To take advantage of inspect features on browser to mess around with CSS styling, rather than changing the code on VS Code and testing over and over again.
Lesson two: Making a website look nicer takes some time, so give yourself some time to come up with creative ideas.

## Examples:
