# My NASA API Project
This project involves entering in a date, to which it will return live NASA published on that date. Examples of this includes a photo/video, along with an explanation of said photo and/or video.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I utilized the fetch API method (using the concept of RESTful APIs) to request data from a unqiue NASA url.
I then converted that data into JSON format for JavaScript readability purposes, and used that to access information such as properties within that data. 
After, I proceeded to manipulate the DOM using document query selectors to replace the html content, with content in those properties being provided by the NASA API.
In the CSS file, I styled very simple parts of the page such as the background color, alignment of content, and margin-spacing. 
Most of the project was done using JavaScript.

## Optimizations
Set the maximum width of images and videos to 100%, in order to improve responsiveness for all devices. All content in the website is responsive.

## Lessons Learned:

Learning how JSON reads url requests and then enables you to read data in Objects, as well as how to manipulate the DOM and replace the html content inside tags with the data from an API.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples:
